A simple solar system simulation written in python and pygame. The simulation uses newton's laws of gravitation to calculate the forcces exterted on each planet for each frame, then I use an euler approximation method to simulate the position and velocity of the bodies based on the acceleration obtained from the force. This is an approximation since I am assuming the acceleration remains constant between the frames. This means a higher framrate results in a more accurate simulation
